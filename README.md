# CPI
This project aims to develop a user-friendly website for managing the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of India.
The website allows users to add new products and states to the database, which can then be used to calculate and display the CPI for different regions and time periods.
The website has been developed using HTML and CSS for the web pages, and Python Flask to integrate it with a SQLite database.

The CPI is an important economic indicator that measures changes in the prices of goods and services over time. By providing an intuitive and accessible platform for managing CPI data, this website aims to help users better understand and analyze inflation trends in India.
The ability to add new products and states to the database also allows for greater flexibility in analyzing CPI data for specific regions and sectors.

Overall, this project serves as a valuable tool for researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in tracking inflation trends in India. With its user-friendly interface and robust database capabilities, it provides a comprehensive and efficient solution for managing CPI data.
